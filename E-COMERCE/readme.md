## 🛠️ Technologies Used

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Product Display**: Products are listed dynamically in the HTML.
2. **Add to Cart**: Clicking "Add to Cart" stores product info in LocalStorage and updates the cart.
3. **Remove from Cart**: Each item in the cart has a "Remove" button to delete it.
4. **LocalStorage**: Cart data is saved in the browser, so it's not lost on refresh.
